       <u>about my self</u>
   </h2>
   <p>I am a young man aged 20 and I like watching movies as a hobbie and I hate sports but I do participate some how. I grew up with my parents in a small surbub called "Northend"in bulawayo and I guess I prefer living a simple life.Am also a hard worker in terms of endurance and dedication to the tasks given, time conscious, love working in groups towards building something big something with the ability to change the social way of life and adopted to the fast changing environment.
